<p> I haven't had many opportunities to film different events. When <br>
I was still in school I got the opportunity to make a video for a charity event. <br>
The event was a fashion show for neurofibromatosis. This was my first video I had  <br>
put together. <br>

<p> Then in college, I was assigned to make a video of a fictional product <br>
or company. I decided to make a video of my father woodturing. <br>
